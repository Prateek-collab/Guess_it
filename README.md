# Guess_it
A guessing game based on basic python modules.
Here is a basic implementation of the python module 'Random'.
The system auto selects a random number from a range and asks the user to guess it.
The user is prompted after each guess whether he has to guess lower or higher.
The quickest way to get to the random number is through the binary sort algorithm which is very well implemented in the code.
